## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection Phase
- System waits for at least 6 participants (minimum for group formation)
- Shows real-time status updates as people join
- Works with both live Google Sheets data and mock data for demos

### 2. Group Formation
- Click "üé≤ Create Groups" to trigger algorithmic formation
- System calculates similarity matrices based on music preferences
- Applies constrained clustering to create balanced groups
- Generates humorous names based on group characteristics

### 3. Group Review
- View group cards with roast names, themes, and compatibility scores
- See detailed member information including songs and majors
- Review shared artists and genres that brought the group together
- Check group size distribution and overall balance

### 4. Request Management (Optional)
- Members can request to join different groups via dropdown selection
- System validates requests against group size constraints
- Session organizers review and approve/deny requests
- Real-time updates when requests are processed

### 5. Finalization
- Click "üîí Finalize Groups" to lock assignments
- Celebration effects (balloons) when finalized
- Groups become read-only and ready for activities
- Export functionality for group assignments

## Technical Benefits
